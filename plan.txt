General idea:
    Commercialize the tap in fob system we use at EM.

Hardware
Tapping In:
    1. Fobs
    2. Fob reader
    3. Computer/Pi to receive and process fob data
    4. Speakers

System
Back end tracking:
    1. Database of users, fob ids, and matches.
    2. Simple API similar to what exists already
    
Front End:
    1. Slack bot
        -They will have to bring it into a channel
        -Simple updates to game status and losers/winners
        -Add links to the leaderboard page.
    2. Dedicated site
        -Leaderboard
        -Admin login to add/remove/update users

Fob Puck:
    1. JS web page like EM. It will have a health ping, and able to receive a refresh page command (to refresh JS code)
    2. It holds game state just like EM system (prevent delay and conflicting ajax calls)
    3. Is a linux distro that does nothing but opens up browser to my page. Each puck installed with a token that maps to client

Hosting
    1. PythonAnywhere setup with remote DB access and Git pull
    2. Sessions for security (hit token page, verify running pi, logs in, everything else restricted)
    3. Make users page. Single login for an admin, and gives lists to make users and assign rfid
    4. Make leaderboard page accisble via token url (big hash, but otherwise open to public). Link from slack.
    5. Make Slack bot based on basic URL hooks (they can install a slackbot and give me url or set it in admin page)
